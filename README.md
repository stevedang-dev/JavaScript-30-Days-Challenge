# JavaScript-30-Days-Challenge
30 days of learning JavaScript from WesBos JavaScript30 Course. Create/build some fun stuff by using just JavaScript.

## About

Build 30 things in 30 days with vanilla JavaScript; no frameworks, libraries, etc.
- Pacing is totally up to the individual; if you feel like knocking out 30 challenges in 30 minutes, hey, more power to you, but that would miss the point of this course (IMO).
- The idea behind these exercises is to utilize small amounts of what would regularly be 'downtime' as moments in which we can build on our knowledge through some simple exercises.
